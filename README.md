 Employee Attrition Prediction (Data Science Group Project)  This project was completed as part of my university Data Science Principles class.   The goal was to analyze employee data and build a machine learning model to predict "employee attrition" (whether an employee will leave the company).


## ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data overview, types, and missing values
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Visualizations (class balance, histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Dropped irrelevant columns
   - Encoded target variable (Attrition)
   - Encoded categorical features
   - Confirmed no missing values

3. **Model Training**
   - Train-test split
   - Models tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Compared models to select best performer

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
